This is a basic chess engine (the name is a reference to Deep Blue).

Currently only works on Windows\
To compile and run, enter the command `./run`\
Once compiled, it can be rerun with `./main`

If the config file is not used, the depth will be 3, and the board will be shown without coordinates from the pov of the color you are playing. The randomness will be based on the difficulty.\
The config file can be used to choose a depth, randomness, color, and visual options.
